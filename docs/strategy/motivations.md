# <a name="motivations-why-are-we-moving-to-the-cloud"></a>Motivations: Why are we moving to the cloud?

"Why are we moving to the cloud?" is a common question for business and technical stakeholders alike. If the answer is, "Our board (or CIO, or C-level executives) told us to move to the cloud," it's unlikely that the business will achieve the desired outcomes.

This article discusses a few motivations behind cloud migration that can help produce more successful business outcomes. These options help facilitate a conversation about motivations and, ultimately, business outcomes.

## <a name="motivations"></a>動機

Business transformations that are supported by cloud adoption can be driven by various motivations. It's likely that several motivations apply at the same time. The goal of the lists in the following table is to help spark ideas about which motivations are relevant. From there, you can prioritize and assess the potential impacts of the motivations. In this article, we recommend that your cloud adoption team meet with various executives and business leaders using the list below to understand which of these motivations are affected by the cloud adoption effort.

## <a name="classify-your-motivations"></a>Classify your motivations

Your motivations for cloud adoption will likely fall into multiple categories. As you're building the list of motivations, trends will likely emerge. Motivations tend to be associated more with one classification than with others. Use the predominant classification to help guide the development of your cloud adoption strategy.

When a response to critical business events is the highest priority, it's important to engage early in [cloud implementation](../getting-started/migrate.md#cloud-implementation), often in parallel with strategy and planning efforts. Taking this approach requires a growth mindset and a willingness to iteratively improve processes, based on direct lessons learned.

When migration is the highest priority, [strategy and planning](../getting-started/migrate.md#cloud-strategy-and-planning) will play a vital role early in the process. We recommend that you [implement the first workload](../getting-started/migrate.md#cloud-implementation) in parallel with planning, to help the team understand and anticipate any learning curves that are associated with cloud adoption.

When innovation is the highest priority, strategy and planning will require additional investments early in the process to ensure balance in the portfolio and wise alignment of the investment made during cloud adoption. For further information and guidance, see [Understand the innovation journey](../getting-started/innovate.md).

To ensure wiser decision-making, all participants in the migration process should have a clear awareness of their motivations. The following section outlines how customers can guide and effect wiser decisions through consistent, strategic methodologies.

## <a name="motivation-driven-strategies"></a>Motivation-driven strategies

This section highlights the *Migration* and *Innovation* motivations and their corresponding strategies.

### <a name="migration"></a>移轉

The *Migration* motivations listed near the top of the Motivations table are the most common, but not necessarily the most significant, reasons for adopting the cloud. These outcomes are important to achieve, but they're most effectively used to transition to other, more useful worldviews. This important first step to cloud adoption is often called a *cloud migration*. The framework refers to the strategy for executing a cloud migration by using the term [Migrate](../getting-started/migrate.md).

Some motivations align well with a migrate strategy. The motives at the top of this list will likely have significantly less business impact than those toward the bottom of the list.

- Cost savings.
- Reduction in vendor or technical complexity.
- Optimization of internal operations.
- 增加企業的靈活性。
- 準備新的技術功能。
- 調整以符合市場需求。
- 調整以符合地理需求。

### <a name="innovation"></a>創新

Data is the new commodity. Modern apps are the supply chain that drives that data into various experiences. In today's business market, it's hard to find a transformative product or service that isn't built on top of data, insights, and customer experiences. 在*創新*清單中較低的動機，會與此架構中稱為[創新](../getting-started/innovate.md)的技術策略一致。

下列清單所包含的動機，會使 IT 組織更專注于創新策略，而不是遷移策略。

- 增加企業的靈活性。
- 準備新的技術功能。
- 建立新的技術功能。
- 調整以符合市場需求。
- 調整以符合地理需求。
- 改善客戶體驗與合作。
- 轉換產品或服務。
